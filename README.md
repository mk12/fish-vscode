# Fish VS Code

A [Fish] plugin that augments the [VS Code] CLI.

## Installation

Use [Fisher]:

```fish
fisher install mk12/fish-vscode
```

## Usage

Just use the `code` function. This does two new things on top of the regular VS Code CLI:

- On macOS, it uses `open -b com.microsoft.VSCode` which is faster and avoids a dock animation.
- On Linux, if `~/.vscode-server` exists, it assumes you're ssh'd to a server and tries to open the file in your local VS Code client.
